### 1. In the following question, you will consider incidence and prevalence. Decide whether incidence, prevalence, or both, have the following characteristics, and briefly explain why.

  (a) Measure of risk.

  (b) Generally preferred for chronic diseases without clear date of onset

  (c) Affected by duration of illness

### 2. Which of the following is true?

  (a) All proportions are ratios, but all ratios are not proportions.
  
  (b) All ratios are proportions, but all proportions are not ratios.

### 3. Proportionate mortality is the proportion of deaths in a specified population during a period of time that are attributable to different causes. Each cause is expressed as a percentage of all deaths, and the sum of the causes adds up to 100%. 

  (a) Does proportionate mortality satisfy the definition of a rate? What about a proportion?
  
  (b) Consider the following table. What is the proportionate mortality associated with COVID-19 in 2020?
  
  (c) Using the same table, what is the proportionate mortality associated with COVID-19 in 2015-2020?
  
  (d) Let's compare the proportionate mortality associated with COVID-19 and cancer in 2020. Calculate an appropriate statistic to quantify this relationship and explain in one sentence how to interpret it.
